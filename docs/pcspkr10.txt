Description             : Finally the last piece in the puzzle of the Doom
                          WAD format has been solved!  While every other
                          lump format contained in the Doom IWADs was long
                          ago reverse engineered, one last mystery
                          remained: the PC speaker sound effects.  This is
                          a technical description of the PC speaker file
                          format, determined through reverse engineering
                          the Vanilla Doom executables.
                          
                          Also included is some example code for
                          generating and playing back PC speaker sound
                          effects, and a WAD containing some replacement
                          sound effects.
